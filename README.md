# NuxtJS Jam Stack Style Portfolio Site
## Introduction
My personal portfolio site, built with Vue.js (Nuxt.js) and Bulma, hosted on Netlify.

## Progress of project
Basic skeleton with HTML content finished

## Planned changes
- Mobile friendly header/menu/nav.
- UX features like smooth scrolling, hover/focus effects, and more color and pop.
- content architecture, explore Nuxt Content to have CMS-like function.

$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
