- I took Slickdeals’ legacy ad platform and modernized the codebase using modern JavaScript standards. I used test driven development while refactoring the platform which enabled the iterative introduction of unit tests to the codebase. This work resulted in a ~10% average uplift in ad revenue, and greatly simplified the use of ads throughout the Slickdeals’ ecosystem.
- I worked with my team to stand up a micro frontend service on EKS. This enabled us to serve server side rendered frontend components, enabling product teams to use VueJS for frontend component development. I then worked with my team to build an islands architecture onto the Slickdeals website and other Slickdeals platforms to leverage the micro frontends service.
