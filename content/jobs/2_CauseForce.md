- I was the development lead on a corporate site rebranding project using Vue and Tailwind.
- I architected a Node based microservice to integrate data from Strava’s webhooks and APIs to web apps for clients. This involved standing up a service on Heroku that subscribes to Strava’s webhook events, stores authentication info for users, and then sends information from Strava’s events to the Luminate Online platform to be leveraged by web apps.
- I helped my team launch over 20 production websites and web apps for clients, leveraging Luminate Online’s API to create web apps for specialized charity events.
